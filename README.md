## Initialize this template

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm run init
```

After everything is done - commit the changes and push them to git.   
Then start developing your library.

#### Initialization process

1. Get all available static information about the current repository:
    - Git repository owner
    - Git repository name
    - Folder name
    - Current year for license
2. Run the interactive menu for clarification the collected information and
   for asking additional questions to obtain information that cannot be obtained
   from static code
    - Package name (default: folder name)
    - Package description (default: empty)
    - Package version (default: 0.0.0-alpha.0)
    - Package author (default: git user name)
    - Package author email (default: git user email)
    - Repository URL (default: git repository URL)
    - License owner (default: git user name)
3. Replace all text markers in the templates with the collected information
    - `<root_dir>/LICENSE`
    - `<root_dir>/package.json`
    - `<root_dir>/README.md`
4. Clean current README.md
    - Cut off all text before the line with the marker "CUT OFF HERE"
5. Delete the initialization sources
    - delete `<root>/src/init` folder
    - delete unneeded dependencies from `package.json`
